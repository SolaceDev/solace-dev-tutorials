## Obtaining the Solace PubSub+ API


The latest versions of all Solace APIs can be downloaded from the [solace downloads page](https://www.solace.com/downloads/). Otherwise, check the public samples repository of the API where the library is already packaged as a gzipped tar file. Note: always check for the latest API version!
